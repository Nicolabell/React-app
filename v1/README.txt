--React app--
Project as learned from the tutorials at https://www.udemy.com/course/full-stack-crash-course 
I'm running through this course to learn a bit of React / db interaction

What I learned / references:

Tailwind colors palette: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors
Prettier extension to keep everything tidy
Some google fonts have loads of extra padding on the bottom which throws out padding etc!
Useful for aligning one thing to the left in flexbox -  margin-left: auto;
Correct way to arrange sudo classes for links
Supabase for simple backend set up
Use API keys, async function, await fetch to load data 
Querying data to filter within a function
Using state within an app

------
Accessibility tweaks TO DO:

-Sort out form labels and add aria described by for input fields
-Work out how to create live region for updated list? or other solution
-Make sure contrast on placeholder text is readable - amend default css for the design
-Use em or rem for font size
-test contrast for suggested link colour palette

------
Extra stuff I learned outside the tutorials:

Create a gitignore file at https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore
